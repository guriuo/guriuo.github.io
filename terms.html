            <p>Welcome to GuriUp! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the GuriUp mobile application (the "App") and any related services provided by GuriUp ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

                <li>Post, transmit, or otherwise make available any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.</li>

                <li>Collect or store personal data about other users without their express consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3. User Content</h3>
            <p>If the App allows you to post, upload, or submit content (e.g., property listings, reviews, photos), you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. However, by submitting content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your content in connection with the App and our business.</p>

            <h2>4. Property Listings and Bookings</h2>
            <h3>4.1. Accuracy of Listings</h3>
            <p>GuriUp acts as a platform to connect users with properties and hotels. We do not own, manage, or inspect the listed properties. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of any listings or information provided by third-party property owners or agents. It is your responsibility to verify all information before making any booking or transaction.</p>
            <h3>4.2. Transactions</h3>
            <p>Any booking or rental agreements made through the App are solely between you and the respective property owner/hotel. GuriUp is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to them. You are responsible for all terms, conditions, and payments associated with your bookings.</p>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality (excluding user-provided content) are and will remain the exclusive property of GuriUp and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the country of Somalia and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of GuriUp.</p>

            <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. GURIUP MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER VIOLATION OF RIGHTS. FURTHER, GURIUP DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE ACCURACY, LIKELY RESULTS, OR RELIABILITY OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS ON ITS APP OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO SUCH MATERIALS OR ON ANY SITES LINKED TO THIS SITE.</p>

            <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL GURIUP OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA OR PROFIT, OR DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MATERIALS ON GURIUP'S APP, EVEN IF GURIUP OR A GURIUP AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED ORALLY OR IN WRITING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

            <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GuriUp, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account's) violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>9. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the App.</p>

            <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Somalia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Somalia, in accordance with the rules of the relevant arbitration body. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties.</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>
